.SH NAME
ganglia \- GMon command line client

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B ganglia
[\fB\-h\fR,\fB\-\-help\fR]
[\fB\-\-format\fR=\fIval\fR]
[\fB\-\-formatarg\fR=\fIval\fR]
[\fB\-\-formatarg\fR=\fIval\fR]
[\fB\-\-input\fR=\fIval\fR]
[\fB\-\-select\fR=\fIval\fR]
[\fB\-\-selectargs\fR=\fIval\fR]
[\fB\-\-xml\fR] [metric list]


.SH DESCRIPTION

This ganglia client parses the XML output of a GMon daemon and
reformats the data in a mode suitable for humans or MDS.  The human
readable format mimics the behavior of the ganglia client from version
1.0 of ganglia (before they switched to XML).  The MDS format is
tracking the Globus Glue Schema and should be considered a work in
progress.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-\-format\fR=\fIval\fR

Sets the output format of the client to \fIDefault\fR, or \fIMDS\fR.
The \fIDefault\fR format is ASCII text with one row for each host with
a column for each metric.  The \fIMDS\fR format is LDIFF and tracks
the Globus Glue Schema.  Note that Ganglia does not currently
implement all the metrics required for the Glue Schema.

.TP
\fB\-\-select\fR=\fIval\fR

Selects the hosts and metrics to be reports to \fIDefault\fR, or
\fIAll\fR.  The \fIDefault\fR selection is to report all only the
metrics listed on the command line for all hosts.  The \fIAll\fR
selection reports all metrics for all hosts.  The \fIMDS\fR format
ignores this option and always reports all relevant metrics for all
hosts.

.TP
\fB\-\-input\fR=\fIfile\fR

Tells the client to read its XML data from a \fIfile\fR rather than the
local GMon daemon.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR,\fB\-\-help\fR

Prints a simple help message.

.TP
\fB\-\-xml\fR


Dumps the raw XML received from the gmon daemon.  The result is the
same as if you connected directly to the gmon using telnet.

.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
$ ganglia load_one cpu_num

Prints the \fIload_one\fR and \fIcpu_num\fR metrics for each host in
the cluster.

.TP

$ ganglia --help

Prints help message and a list of metrics reported on the clusters.

.TP

$ ganglia --format=MDS

Invokes ganglia as an MDS provider.
