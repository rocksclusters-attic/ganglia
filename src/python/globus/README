These are the modifications that were made to the MDS:

1) Added monitoring.schema file in the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc directory. 
This has the object classes and the attributes for the ganglia data. There are 
3 object classes: clusterData, hostData, and metricData. These are all 3
independent classes not a hierarchy. This makes querying more logical. So 
if you just want the clusterData then you query for objectclass=clusterData.
You can also filter for what fields you would like from the attributes.

2) Modified the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-info-sldap.conf

-Added 'sizelimit 1000' at the top of the file. This sets the size limit 
of the mds to return 1000 objects (each object is something that starts with 
a dn: line). This can be increased as needed. The default for the MDS is 500
and it needed to be increased b/c there is more data then that returned 
from ganglia.

-Added
include 	<SCHEMA FILE>
ex. include	/usr/local/apps/globus-2.0-beta/etc/monitoring.schema

-Modified the line 'schemacheck off' to 'schemacheck on' so that it would
return warnings about the schema.

3) Added information to the grid-info-resource-ldif.conf file

dn: MDS-service=metricData, Mds-Host-hn=slic00.sdsc.edu, Mds-Vo-name=local, o=grid
objectclass: GlobusTop
objectclass: GlobusActiveObject
objectclass: GlobusActiveSearch
type: exec
path:  <PATH TO THE SCRIPT>
base: ganglia
args: --format=MDS --select=All
cachetime: 0
timelimit: 20
sizelimit: 0

4) Once these files are changed you need to restart the gris. Do this by
running $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXgris stop and then SXXgris start. 
Anytime a file is modified the gris must be restarted.

Additional Notes:
-You can enable debugging by going into the SXXgris file located in the
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin directory. Look for the line that has
grid-info-soft-register and change the -d 0 to -d <SOME#>. The higher the
number the more information will come out at you.
