	<title> Enabling fully aware Ganglia daemons </title>

<para>
For maximum performance and scalability, the Ganglia <emphasis>gmond</emphasis>
daemons on compute nodes in the cluster are run in "deaf" mode. While compute nodes
report their own Ganglia data to the frontend, they do not listen for information from
their peers. This reduces the resource footprint of compute nodes.
</para>
<para>
Running the compute node monitors in deaf mode means they cannot be queried for
cluster state. This may be a problem if your parallel jobs use Ganglia data for
performance analysis or fault tolerance purposes. If you would like to re-enable
Ganglia's full functionality on your compute nodes, follow the instructions below.

<tip>
<para>
Ganglia daemons were switched to the deaf mode by default starting in the Matterhorn
Rocks release 3.1.0.
