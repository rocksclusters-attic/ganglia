#
# Revision 1.11  2006/12/02 01:04:59  anoop
# Ridiculously big ass commit.
# Also known as the week after thanksgiving 2006. Or "The day Anoop
# broke Rocks".
#
# Main Changes.
#
# 1. Added a roll-profile.mk file. This is meant as a makefile for building
# the profile rpm containing all the XML files meant for the roll. This is a
# breakaway from the spec.in file method of building the profile RPM.
#
# 2. The variable PWD is now changed to CURDIR. The main reason for this is
# PWD is supplied by the shell. CURDIR is the variable supplied by gmake itself.
# This means we can have a slightly more platform independant way of doing things.
# Also Solaris was failing to set PWD correctly in the source directories, wreaking
# havoc on the location of the BUILD and PKG directories.

# Revision 1.1  2005/03/08 00:03:34  fds
# The Ganglia Roll. Moved all relevant source from rocks/src/ganglia here.
# Uses Ganglia v2.5.x.
#
# Revision 1.2  2005/01/18 16:28:09  fds
# Normalized stylesheets and stylesheet-images: no longer is rocks.dsl
# repeated for every roll by default. The pdf and html targets perform better
# when used on their own (for testing).
#
# Revision 1.1  2004/11/30 01:42:10  fds
# Normalize! This usersguide has a DOCROOT make var that pulls stylesheet-images
# and rocks.css, rocks.dsl from a central location in CVS. These are currently
# copied in several locations, namely rocks/src/roll/grid/src/usersguide, and
# rocks/src/roll/condor/src/usersguide among others.
