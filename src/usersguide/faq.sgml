<question id="ganglia-restart">
<para>
I see IP addresses but not names in my Ganglia graphs.  Why is this?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
The DNS system in the cluster sometimes causes Ganglia to record bogus
node names (usually their IP addresses).  To clear this situation,
restart the "gmond" and "gmetad" services on the frontend.  This action
may be useful later, as it will flush any dead nodes from the Ganglia
output.

<para>
<screen>
# service gmond restart
# service gmetad restart
</screen>
</para>

<para>
This method is also useful when replacing or renaming nodes in your
cluster.

<question id="ganglia-parse-error">
<para>
When looking at the Ganglia page, I don't see graphs, just the error:
</para>

<para>
<computeroutput>
There was an error collecting ganglia data (127.0.0.1:8652): XML error:
not well-formed (invalid token) at xxx
</computeroutput>
</para>

</question>

<answer>
<para>
This indicates a parse error in the Ganglia gmond XML output.  It is
generally caused by non-XML characters (&amp; especially) in the cluster
name or cluster owner fields, although any Ganglia field (including node
names) with these characters will cause this problem.
</para>

<para>
We hope future versions of Ganglia will correctly escape all names to
make them XML safe.  If you have a bad name,
edit <literal>/etc/ganglia/gmond.conf</literal> on the frontend node,
remove the offending characters, then restart gmond.
