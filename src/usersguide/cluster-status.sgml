	<title> Cluster Status </title>

<para>
The webpages available from this link provide a graphical interface to live 
cluster information provided by <ulink 
url="http://ganglia.info/">Ganglia monitors</ulink> running on each 
cluster node. The monitors gather values for various metrics such as CPU load, 
free memory, disk usage, network I/O, operating system version, etc. These 
metrics are sent through the private cluster network and are used by the 
frontend node to generate the historical graphs.

<para>
In addition to metric parameters, a heartbeat message from each node is 
collected by the Ganglia monitors.
When a number of heartbeats from any node are 
missed, this web page will declare it "dead". These dead nodes often have 
problems which require additional attention, and are marked with the 
Skull-and-Crossbones icon, or a red background.

The Rocks Cluster Group maintains a similar web page called 
<emphasis>Meta</emphasis> that collects Ganglia information from many clusters 
built with Rocks software. It may give you a glimpse of the power and 
scalability of the Ganglia monitors. The meta page is available at <ulink 
url="http://meta.rocksclusters.org/">http://meta.rocksclusters.org/</ulink>.

<para>
<ulink url="http://ganglia.info/">Ganglia</ulink> was designed at 
Berkeley by Matt Massie (massie@cs.berkeley.edu) in 2000, and is currently 
developed by an open source partnership between Berkeley, SDSC, and others. It 
is distributed through Sourceforge.net under the GPL software liscence.
